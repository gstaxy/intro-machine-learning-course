# Introduction to Machine Learning with Python

Welcome! This is a beginner-friendly, practical introduction to machine learning using Python.

> üí° Inspired by *[Machine Learning Mastery with Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-with-python/)* book, this course walks you through core ML concepts step by step, with real code and clear explanations. It's a trimmed down adapted version of the first half modules with the essential to get you started quick.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This course requires a basic knowledge of python programming. If you don't have prior experience with python, I highly recommend completing the *[Codeacademy: Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)* course for a smoother learning curve.
