# Introduction to Machine Learning with Python

Welcome! This is a beginner-friendly, practical introduction to machine learning using Python.

*Disclaimers*: 
- All the content is in French as this course was created and developed for a French speaking environment. It's not planned to translate the content to English - unless there's is demand.
- It was developed based on the latest technologies and library versions from back in 2021. With the rise of LLMs, many of the taught concepts could now be adapted to the current reality. However, the content remains highly relevant when approaching learning from a pragmatic and foundational POV.

> üí° Inspired by *[Machine Learning Mastery with Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-with-python/)* book, this course walks you through core ML concepts step by step, with real code and clear explanations. It's a trimmed down adapted version of the first half modules with the essential to get you started quick.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This course requires a basic knowledge of python programming. If you don't have prior experience with python, I highly recommend completing the *[Codeacademy: Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)* course for a smoother learning curve.
