# Introduction to Machine Learning with Python

Welcome! This is a beginner-friendly, practical introduction to machine learning using Python.

*Important notes*: 
- All the content is in French as this course was created and developed for a French speaking environment. It's not planned to translate the content to English - unless there's is demand.
- It was developed based on the latest technologies and library versions from back in 2021. With the rise of LLMs, many of the taught concepts could now be adapted to the current reality. However, the content remains highly relevant when approaching learning from a pragmatic and foundational POV.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This course requires a basic knowledge of python programming. If you don't have prior experience with python, I highly recommend completing the *[Codeacademy: Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)* course for a smoother learning curve.
